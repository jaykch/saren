    question: "Why should I use your platform instead of CMC or Coingecko?",
    answer: "People will get tokens daily for using it which they can sell to " +
      "companies who need them to be able to list the coins. This way it will be a " +
      "closed ecosystem where the community is rewarded instead of let's say binance in the case of CMC."
  },
  {
    key: 2,
    question: "What does cerberus offer that the competition is lacking?",
    answer: "For now we don't offer anything other than decentralisation, if a coin is on coingecko you can already import " +
      "it on the app without needing anyone's permission. Once we have finished the node, " +
      "companies can list their coin directly without anyone's permission, " +
      "the community will vote if the data is correct through a governance " +
      "smart contract and the coin will be listed automatically in a trustless way."
  },

    key: 3,
    question: "What are the things that weâ€™re trying to solve with creating our own platform?",
    answer: "We are trying to build a wikipedia for crypto prices and details. Additionally, " +
      "we are trying to give the power back to the people instead of these big companies like binance."
