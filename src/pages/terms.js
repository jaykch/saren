          U.S. federal law and the laws of Delaware, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree
          that any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with the Service, and/or these Terms shall be
          litigated solely in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in Delaware, and you further
          irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and waive any objection to jurisdiction and
          venue (including on the basis of forum non-conveniens).</p><p>You acknowledge that any breach of either of the
          sections above titled "Prohibited Activities" or "Ownership and Intellectual Property” would cause immediate
          and irreparable harm to Orbit, for which monetary damages would not be sufficient, and that, in addition to
          all
          other remedies available to Orbit at law or in equity, Orbit shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
          without
          proof of damages or the posting of bond or other security in the event of such a breach or threatened
          breach.</p></section>
        <section><h3>General</h3><p>These Terms (and any
          other terms or agreements referenced herein, including our Privacy Policy, which is located at
          <Link to="/privacy">https://orbitdefi.com/privacy</Link>), constitute the entire agreement
          between you and Orbit relating to your use of the Service and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
          communications, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Orbit with respect to the Service. A
          printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
          administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same
          conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>
          <p>You agree that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment relationship exists between you and
            Orbit
            and/or its affiliates as a result of these Terms or use of the Service.</p><p>In no event shall Orbit be
            responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out
            of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes,
            work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural
            catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or
            computer (software and hardware) services.</p><p>Our performance under these Terms is subject to existing
            laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms limits our right to comply with law enforcement
            or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Service or information
            provided to, or gathered by, us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree
            that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of this
            Service within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or
            cause of action will be irrevocably waived.</p><p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted
            hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Orbit without restriction. Any
            attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p><p>If any provision
            of these Terms, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set
            forth above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable
            provisions in these Terms shall be deemed superseded by valid and enforceable provisions that, to the extent
            possible, fulfill the business purposes and intent of such invalid and unenforceable provisions.</p><p>In
            addition to and without limiting the preceding paragraph, some U.S. states and foreign countries may provide
            rights in addition to those provided in the above "Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability" section or do
            not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential
            damages. Therefore, the limitations set forth in the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability section
            may not apply to you in whole or in part or there may be state or country specific provisions that supersede
            such limitations in whole or in part. Any provision of the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
            section that is declared invalid shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or
            enforceability of the remainder.</p><p>Any heading or section title contained herein is for convenience of
            reference only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms. The terms "include" and
            "including" are deemed to include the phrase "without limitation" immediately thereafter.</p></section>
