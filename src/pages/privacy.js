          from a Website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are required to use some
          Orbit services. Orbit and its ad management partners (“Ad Partners”) use cookies to record

          beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was
          viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the Ad Partners. Web

          learn which advertisements bring users to our Website.</p><p>With both cookies and web beacon technology, the
          information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your
          name, address, geographic location, telephone number, or e-mail address.</p><p>You can opt-out of Google
